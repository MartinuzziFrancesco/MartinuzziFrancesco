### Hello there!

I am Francesco Martinuzzi, a PhD student in Physics and Earth Sciences at Leipzig University in Germany.
I am under the supervision of Prof. [**Miguel D. Mahecha**](https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en/profile/mitarbeiter/prof-dr-miguel-dario-mahecha-ordonez/) and Dr. [**Karin Mora**](https://aperiodik.is/) at the Remote Sensing Centre for Earth System Research [**RSC4Earth**](https://rsc4earth.de/). My research is kindly funded by the Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence [**ScaDS.AI**](https://scads.ai/). I am also part of the [**ELLIS Society**](https://ellis.eu/projects/modeling-impacts-of-extreme-events-using-reservoir-computing), and as part of its exchange program I am currently spending six months as a visiting researcher at the Universitat de Val√®ncia working with Prof. [**Gustau Camps-Valls**](https://www.uv.es/gcamps/). 
    
I enjoy coding in Julia, on my profile you can find some of the repositories I work/collaborate on. For anything machine learning/dynamical system related don't esitate to get in thouch with me!
