### Hello there!

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Physics and Earth Sciences at Leipzig University, Germany, and Valencia, Spain, as a member of the [**ELLIS PhD program**](https://ellis.eu/projects/modeling-impacts-of-extreme-events-using-reservoir-computing). My research focuses on the application of machine learning in Earth systems. I am part of the team at the Remote Sensing Center for Earth System Research (RSC4Earth), working under the supervision of Prof. [**Miguel D. Mahecha**](https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en/profile/mitarbeiter/prof-dr-miguel-mahecha) and Dr. [**Karin Mora**](https://aperiodik.is/). In addition, I have an affiliation with the Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (ScaDS.AI).
    
I enjoy coding in Julia, on my profile you can find some of the repositories I work/collaborate on. For anything machine learning/dynamical system related don't hesitate to get in thouch with me!
